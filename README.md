Hello! I’m Jill and this is a repository of the projects I’ve completed to showcase my skills and progress in data analytics. 

These projects showcase my skills in data gathering, data exploration and data analysis. If you’re interested in seeing my visualizations, you can find those at Tableau Public.

**Why Data?**
I’ve always been drawn to discovering new viewpoints and ways of examining data. It’s a skill I honed as a history major during my years at UC Irvine when I learned about ’The 5 Cs of Historical Thinking,” which include: 

	1. Change over time
	2. Causality
	3. Context
	4. Complexity
	5. Contingency

I learned to examine change over time from multiple viewpoints to find the causality or context of an outcome with complex data that’s contingent upon other data. Sound familiar? It was basically data analysis on historical events. I thrived in this environment and I took these skills with me when I entered the TV and film industry. There, I turned scripted words into visual presentations and designs that would convey the story. Much like data visualizations using Tableau. 

Data analysis was a natural evolution and I’m excited to bring what I’ve learned throughout the years into a new context. 



**Contents / Projects**

**Project #1 - [Data Salaries](https://github.com/jillsalaver/SQL/blob/f153c0da6ea4e08b368e9e212a92be6e977e19b4/Data%20Salaries.sql)**
This project was an exploration of data science salaries from a dataset downloaded from Kaggle. I wanted to analyze data salaries according to geography, experience level and over time, leaning heavily on aggregate functions to explore the data. 


**Project #2 - [SQL Murder Mystery](https://github.com/jillsalaver/SQL/blob/f153c0da6ea4e08b368e9e212a92be6e977e19b4/SQL%20Murder%20Mystery)**
This one was for pure fun and practice. Knightly created a whodunnit that can only be solved with SQL queries. It utilizes skills such as joins, primary keys and data filtering. The database includes 9 tables that stores information on witnesses, potential suspects and of course, the killer! If you're interested in solving the mystery yourself, you can find it [here](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)
